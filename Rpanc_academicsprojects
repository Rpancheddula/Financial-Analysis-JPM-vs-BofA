Project Overview & Objective

The goal of this project was to conduct a deep-dive comparative analysis of two of the world's leading financial institutions. By leveraging financial statements and key performance indicators, we aimed to determine which bank demonstrated stronger financial health and operational control over the 2021-2023 period. The analysis is based on publicly available **10-K filings**, ensuring data integrity and verifiability.

Methodology

Our analysis was built on a foundation of three core financial techniques:

1.  Common-Size Financial Statements: We normalized the income statements of both banks to view each line item as a percentage of total revenue. This allowed for a direct comparison of their cost structures and profitability drivers, revealing that JPM consistently maintained stronger profit margins.

2.  Ratio Analysis: We calculated and compared critical financial ratios to evaluate performance across profitability, efficiency, solvency, and liquidity. This provided a quantitative basis for our conclusions.

3.  SWOT Analysis & Strategic Recommendations: The quantitative findings were synthesized into a SWOT (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats) analysis for JPMorgan Chase. Based on this, we formulated actionable strategic recommendations, such as investing in FinTech/AI to improve margins and compete with digital banks.

Key Findings & Insights

Our analysis concluded that JPMorgan Chase demonstrated superior financial performance and operational control compared to Bank of America during the analyzed period.

->Profitability: JPM consistently held a stronger profit margin across all three years. In 2023, JPM's profit margin was 30.5% compared to BofA's 17.9%, which declined sharply that year.

->Returns to Shareholders: JPM generated significantly higher Return on Equity (ROE), ending 2023 at 21% versus BofA's 9.79%. This indicates more effective use of shareholder capital.

->Operational Efficiency: Bank of America's higher operating expenses relative to its revenue suggest operational inefficiencies compared to JPM.

->Solvency & Liquidity: JPM maintained a slightly better (lower) Debt-to-Asset ratio. Conversely, BofA showed a higher current ratio, indicating stronger short-term liquidity, though at the cost of lower profitability.
